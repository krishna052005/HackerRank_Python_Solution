students = []

for _ in range(int(input())):
    name = input()
    score = float(input())
    students.append([name, score])

scores = sorted(set([student[1] for student in students]))
second_lowest = scores[1]
names = sorted([student[0] for student in students if student[1] == second_lowest])

for name in names:
    print(name)
